"Mills, we're currently on State 324 Road, heading to Caesar's place. Need help with the exact location."

The countryside stretched out before us as Chuck navigated the narrow straight road, with morning sun, right up our windshield. I took a deep breath and dialled Lieutenant Mills.

‘Mills here, what do you need, Teddy?’

‘Any updates on Caesar's murder, Mills?

‘Still early in the investigation, Teddy. No signs of a break-in, no witnesses saw anything unusual. We're piecing it together.’I sighed, glancing at Chuck, who focused on the road.

‘Alright, keep me posted. Anything odd you've come across?’

Mills hesitated for a moment. ‘Actually, we found something. In a folder on Caesar 's computer labelled “Caesar: An Open Book” we stumbled upon a bunch of mysterious mathematical cipher files. No idea what they mean, but it's got us scratching our heads.’

My instincts flared up, a spark of suspicion igniting within me.

‘The folder's name, Mills?’

‘Yeah, “Caesar: An Open Book”. Thought it was strange considering the circumstances.’

‘Send those files over, Mills. We'll take a look. Keep digging, and let us know if anything else comes up. We're on our way.’

As I hung up, I turned to Chuck.
‘Cipher files, Chuck. Caesar, a scientist, murdered, and now mysterious ciphers. This investigation just took a turn down a rabbit hole. Let's see what these files reveal.’
